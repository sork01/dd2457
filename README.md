# DD2457 Programsemantik och Programanalys

## Lecture 1: Introduction

Semantics means "meaning"


Linguistics: Syntax, semantics, pragmatics


Computer Science: 
*programming languages (java, scheme)*
*database query languages (sql)*


Formal semantics
*meaning = behaviour*
as a mathematical object!

We're interested in the behaviour of the program

*Function: what is the computed object?*

*Time: how many computation steps?*

*Space: how much memory is needed?*

We're not talking about time and space, we're interested in the interaction behaviour

*what sequences of interactions, on-going behaviour, reactive systems*
